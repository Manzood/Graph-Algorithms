# Implementation of the Welsh-Powell Algorithm for graph coloring

Input:
    A graph with 9 vertices and 13 edges.
    The edges are described in subsequent lines.

Output:
    The colors of each vertex are listed, in order from 1 to the final vertex.
    That is, if there are 3 vertices and the output is 1 2 2, this means:
        - vertex 1 has color 1
        - vertex 2 has color 2
        - vertex 3 has color 2


Running instructions (Linux):
    - To run, compile the file with g++ Welsh_Powell.cpp -o Welsh_Powell
    - Following this, run it with ./Welsh_Powell < Sample_Input > Sample_Output
