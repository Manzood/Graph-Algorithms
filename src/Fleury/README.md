# Implementation of Fleury's Algorithm to find Eulerian Circuit

Input:
    A graph with 4 vertices and 4 edges.
    The edges are described in subsequent lines.

Output:
    The path, denoted in the order of vertices visited.


Running instructions (Linux):
    - To run, compile the file with g++ Fleury.cpp -o Fleury
    - Following this, run it with ./Fleury < Sample_Input > Sample_Output
