# Implementing Maximum Matching in a Bipartite Graph

Input:
    A graph with 12 vertices and 8 edges.
    The edges are described in subsequent lines. (1-based indexing)

Output:
    The edges are described (one per line), constituting of a maximum matching of the bipartite graph


Running instructions (Linux):
    - To run, compile the file with g++ Maximum_Matching.cpp -o Maximum_Matching
    - Following this, run it with ./Maximum_Matching < Sample_Input > Sample_Output
