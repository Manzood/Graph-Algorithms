# Graph Theory, Applications and Combinatorics Assigment 1

Points to note:

- The graphs in the Sample Input files are all denoted as follows:
    - The first line contains two integers, the first denoting number of vertices (n) and second denoting number of edges (m).
    - The following m lines describe the edges.
    - If the graph is unweighted, the edges are described with two integers, denoting that there is an edge between those two vertices.
    - If the graph is weighted, then alongside the first two integers denoting the edge, there is a third integer denoting the weight of that edge.

- Simple sample input and output queries have been provided for each implementation. However, the code should work on other queries as well, as long as the correct input format is followed.

- Each folder has the code, along with sample input and output, inside it's respective folder. There is also a README.md file in each folder, that contains instructions on running the code along with a small explanation of sample inputs and outputs.

- The Utility graph generator provided is untested and incomplete, and should not be used.
